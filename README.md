## Bash Scripts Collection

This is a collection of useful Bash scripts


### check_redirects

This script will take the source/destination URIs and performs a CURL command to check if they successfully redirect


### sort_roms

This script will move downloaded roms (in zip form) to a different directory.  It extracts the zip files, moves the rom files to a clone of the RetroPie's rom directory tree and then syncs them over to the Raspberry Pi ready to play.
